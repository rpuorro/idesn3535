<div id="about"><h3>About VectorOctave</h3><p>About VectorOctave
    Developed as an application for a simultaneous
    auditory and visual composition,VectorOctave is a
    drawing platform, an instrument, and
    an experience — meant to be sketched, played,
    and discovered.

    As you draw within the art-board, musical “events” are triggered,
    Just as you would trigger notes to play from a synthesizer when dragging
    your hand across the keys.

    So, for example, the faster you are drawing, the faster the musical notes
    are being played. </p></div>

<div id="howitworks"><h3>How It Works</h3><p>VectorOctave’s Artboard is made up of a coordinate plane,
    which has been populated with an array of musical chords,
    notes, electronic sound samples, percussion, and ambient
    sound effects.

    The sounds have been pre-loaded into the art board and
    programmed to play as soon as your stylus or mouse “hits”
    that particular point on the art board where the sound is located.</p>

    <h5>Color</h5>
    <p>First, click on any of the colored circles within toolbar to select brush color.
        Switching between colors frequently
        throughout your composition will lead to a more dynamic
        experience.</p>

    <h5>Loops</h5>
    <p>Next, choose a percussion loop. 87BPM
        is a good place to start</p>

    <h5>Saving</h5>
    <p>When finished, click the       icon to save,
    or the        icon to clear the artboard and start again.</p>

    <h5>Creating a new composition</h5>
    <p>Click the icon at the bottom of the
    artboard.
    OPENING AN EXISTING COMPOSITION
    Click the folder icon at the bottom of the
    artboard.</p></div>
